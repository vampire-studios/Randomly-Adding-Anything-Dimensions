/**
 * K.jpg's Simplex-Gabor Noise. Gabor-reminiscent noise,
 * based on OpenSimplex 2, smooth variant ("SuperSimplex")
 *
 * <gx, gy> or <gx, gy, gz> should be a unit vector multiplied
 * by the desired relative sinusoid frequency.
 * If picking the vector randomly, then for best results
 * consider smoothness and isotropy.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Only supports basic (and approximated) sinusoidal kernels.
 * - Not normalized in its current version.
 * - You might be able to see some of the underlying triangle grid
 *   in the result, if you look at the gray regions. I don't think
 *   it's as detracting as a square grid, but it's not as nice as
 *   original Gabor noise in that regard.
 * - Gray regions can be reduced a bit, by adding up just the attns
 *   in a 'weights' variable, and returning values/weights.
